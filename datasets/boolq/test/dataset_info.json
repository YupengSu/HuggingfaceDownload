  "description": "SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after\nGLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved\nresources, and a new public leaderboard.\n\nBoolQ (Boolean Questions, Clark et al., 2019a) is a QA task where each example consists of a short\npassage and a yes/no question about the passage. The questions are provided anonymously and\nunsolicited by users of the Google search engine, and afterwards paired with a paragraph from a\nWikipedia article containing the answer. Following the original work, we evaluate with accuracy.",
